Prerequisite
	1. You should have a github and dockerhub account
	2. Your code (app along with test cases) should be there in your github account

CI/CD
	1. You setup a jenkins job.
		Install jenkins
		Install maven
		Install docker
		Install kubernetes
		Setup a jenkins job
		
	
	2. A developer is making a change to the code in github (i.e. commit and push)
	3. Automatically the jenkins job should get triggered.
		This will not happen for you because your jenkins is not hosted on a machine with public ip
		I will show this (only on 19th June, 2020)
		For you, you will trigger the job.
	4. 	Your job
			Download the code from github (jenkins)
			Build the code using maven - generate a war.
			Create a docker image with tomcat and the above war deployed in it.
				You can refer to my dockerfile 
					You would need to make small changes - i will tell you
				Result: You have a docker image
			You will create docker container.
				if already a container with name is running - then delete it.
			Run test cases using maven
				Result: test passes
			Commit and create a new image.
				Result: New image on your machine.
			Push this image to your docker hub.
				Result: New image in dockerhub.
			Deploy it in a kubernetes environment on prodution
				production: your environment.
				
	5. Manually verify
	6. Again make a change to github
	7. Automatically everything should happen
		In our case: you have to trigger and everything should automatically happen.
